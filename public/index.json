I’m here to tell you a better way. That better way is plain text. What is Plain Text? #One way of describing plain text is that it’s just the characters you type, with no formatting whatsoever. But plain text underpins every kind of document you write or interact with on your computer. HTML is, in a sense, ‘plain text’ that’s being interpreted by a web browser to hide certain text that’s not supposed to be shown, and use it as instructions on how to display the web page. Even Microsoft Word documents are, in the background, just plain text with a bunch of stuff that Word hides when you open the document.\nWhy is Plain Text Better? #So, you know when you’re writing something in Word or Google Docs, and you want to paste in some text from somewhere? By default, that text will take on the formatting from its source, which 99% of the time is not the formatting that you have. If you actually care about the document you’re producing1, you’ll then change the formatting to match. Problem solved! Except not. You then try typing something in your document, and goddammit, it has the formatting from that thing I just pasted still! You change it back and then see it popping back up again somewhere else. And wait, why is the line spacing in my document all off all of a sudden? This is because there were hidden formatting characters that you pasted in that are influencing how your text is formatted. Because they’re hidden, it’s difficult to know how they’re influencing the text you write. When you write in plain text, you see everything. And by default, when you paste text into a plain text editor, it will paste only the text, not the hidden formatting characters2. So you have complete control over what’s going into your writing. The other great thing about plain text is that it’s universally readable. Every single computing device ever made will let you open, read and edit a text file. Computers at the end of time will be able to read text files. You don’t have to worry that you’ve saved something in a format the other person won’t have. It may not be pretty, but it will be readable.\nGreat, but What About Formatting? #You might bet the impression that I don’t think formatting is important. It is! Using bold words, headings, and other types of formatting are an essential part of writing good text. And I’m here to tell you that you can format in plain text, using a standard called “Markdown.” Markdown is a way of writing in plain text where you can dictate your formatting by typing special characters into your text. Again, this is already possible with things like HTML, and if you know what you’re doing, you can just write HTML in a text document and have it render with formatting in a browser. But the magic of Markdown is that it’s both easy to understand and very readable in and of itself (unlike HTML.) I won’t give a full guide here to Markdown, but the basics are simple. If you want to bold a word or phrase, you put two asterisks around it like so: I really want to emphasize this point! If you wish to italicize something, just use one asterisk: This pizza is very tasty! To do bullet points, just use a dash: - This is a point - This is another point - Yet another point Want to make a heading? Use the “#” character for a heading, and add more than one for subheadings: # My Big Thought\n## Part One: Thinking This is part one of two, in which I... You can hopefully see above that text you write in this way is readable on its own, but isn’t a replacement for properly formatted text that you want to share. Luckily, because Markdown is an open standard, there are a ton of apps that can take your Markdown writing and produce nicely formatted text. And because the formatting marks are shown, you always know exactly how your text will be formatted. I’m actually writing this post in one of those editors right now, called Ulysses. There are a ton more, and I’ll list out a few of my favourites below. These apps often come with their own nice styles, and often let you customize the theme to get your text looking how you like it. And you can usually export into several different formats, including HTML, PDF, or even, God forbid, Microsoft Word.\nGoing Further #I tend to default almost all of my writing to be in plain text for the reasons I stated above. And recently, I’ve even been experimenting with creating presentations in plain text. There is a class of applications that let you write a text document in Markdown, separating it into ‘slides’ using dashes, and even let you drop in images. Sure, you can’t make a super graphically intense presentation, but I love the appeal of just focusing on the words and the ideas, and letting something figure out the formatting after. It’s an area I want to explore more. List of Plain Text Apps # I linked to Ulysses above. It’s a Markdown editor that focuses on writing and publishing. It’s available for Mac, iPad and iPhone, and syncs all of your work to all your devices using iCloud. BBEdit is a long-standing text editor for the Mac. Its features skew a little towards coders, but it’s super handy as a quick text editor, and has multiple powerful features, like advanced find and replace, line sorting, de-duplicating, etc. It’s like a little factory for plain text. Bear is a great plain text / Markdown notes editor. It formats your text in Markdown as you type without hiding the characters, so you still know what’s happening. It also supports images, and even tables, while still keeping your notes highly exportable. iA Writer is a writing app like Ulysses, but a bit more basic. It’s great for just simple writing needs. iA Presenter is iA’s new presentation app (think PowerPoint or Google Slides) that is powered by plain text but produces beautiful, simple slides. Whenever I see inconsistently formatted text in a document, it’s usually obvious that the author pasted stuff in and that they don’t give a shit about the quality of their work.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIf nothing else, pasting text into a plain text editor before pasting into a word processor is a great way to “launder” your text to make it clean of hidden formatting marks.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"March 30, 2024","permalink":"/posts/plain-text/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Power of Plain Text"},{"content":" thoughts about technology and work In math, a \u0026ldquo;coefficient\u0026rdquo; is a number or constant that multiplies a variable.

I’ve recently figured out a fun way to automate my system using iOS Shortcuts and Reminders (and a couple of helper apps) and thought I’d share here both my budgeting system and the way I automate it.\nAgain, the way you are supposed to budget is not how I budget. What you’re supposed to do is to set aside budget amounts each month for different categories and spend within that amount. So you’d have a certain amount for “eating out” and a certain amount for “coffee” and “entertainment,” etc. And then if you’re low in one area, you can reallocate it to the other area so that your budget balances each month. I’ve tried that in the past, but I’ve always found it too fiddly to categorize all my expenses and keep track of it all. And it just feels weird to me to say “this is how much I want to spend on eating out this month” because what if there are a particular number of restaurant get-to-togethers that you’re invited to in a month that would put you over? And what if I don’t end up eating out a lot one month? Am I supposed to just ‘use up’ that budget?\nInstead, I basically budget as if I live paycheque to paycheque. For every paycheque I get, a certain number of bills and deposits to savings and retirement accounts come out of it, and whatever is left is what I live on. The savings / retirement accounts are the flexible ones, so I generally just try to put as much as I can in those while still leaving enough in my checking account after bills to do ‘fun stuff.’ I do use credit cards to get the points, but I generally pay off my balance as soon as I see it reflected in my credit card account (not when I get the bill at the end of the month.) This way, I can keep my spending in “check” by just focusing on the amount remaining in my checking account after the bills and payments ‘assigned’ to that paycheque come out.\nThis has worked really well for me over the years, but calculating the amount remaining was always a little fiddly. Bills sometimes come out at different times, so I have to keep a running list of what hasn’t been paid and their sum so that I can deduct that amount from my checking account. For a long time, I kept a simple spreadsheet to track this. I’d have a list of all my withdrawals, when they come out, how much is in my checking, and the spreadsheet would calculate the amount remaining. I did this method of tracking for several years, and it was fine, but using spreadsheets on a phone generally sucks. Spreadsheets also aren’t great at letting you ‘check things off’ and build formulas around it.\nEnter Shortcuts + Reminders #I’ve long had the idea to make an iOS app to do my budget tracking, but my iOS developer skills are sub-par at best, and I didn’t think there’d really be enough interest to make it worth the effort. So this fall, I thought I’d try to tackle this using iOS Shortcuts. My thought was that if I could tell a Shortcut how much was left in my checking account, it could look at all the withdrawals that are coming up before my next pay day, and tell me how much I had left. Shortcuts isn’t really great at working with spreadsheets, and I needed an easy way to check things off. So I turned to Apple Reminders. Reminders, of course, makes it straightforward to check things off to mark as complete on a phone. But it’s also a great solution because you can make your reminders repeat on a flexible schedule. This is really handy for tracking withdrawals, as some come out bi-weekly, and some are once a month. So then when I check a bill off, it will automatically re-appear as due the next month. The other nice thing about Reminders is that Shortcuts works really well with Reminders. You can get a list of Reminders that fit certain criteria and then iterate on that list, mark them complete, etc. The simplest way I could think to set it up was to create a specific list called “Money” that it pulls from. I add each withdrawal to that list, each on its specific repeat schedule. Each with withdrawal starts with “$” followed by the amount, a dash, and the name of the bill. And I also add my paycheque to this list (without the amount) on its repeat schedule so that my Shortcut knows when I’m getting paid next. That way, the Shortcut can get a list of all my withdrawals that are happening before my next payday, and sum everything in that list (using some basic parsing to extract just the numbers from the reminders.) When I run the Shortcut, the first thing it does is ask me how much is currently in my checking account. I’d love to figure out how to get this number automatically somehow, but scraping data from a bank account is tricky by design, and I’m very wary of granting a service access to my banking information. So I just remember the number from my chequing account and enter it in when prompted. Once I do that, it will do the logic and summing described above and just tell me how much I have left in my checking account. It’s very mobile-friendly and quick! There are a couple of other tweaks that I’ve added to the Shortcut. The first that I store both the current amount and the calculated remaining amount in Data Jar, the excellent (and free!) app built for storing data for Shortcuts to use. The amount in chequing is so if I run the Shortcut again after checking off a bill reminder, the Shortcut will grab the checking amount and pre-populate it as a default when run once more. The calculated remaining amount is to use as my second tweak, a widget! I thought it would be handy to display the latest amount on a widget on my phone’s Home Screen, so I can check it easily later without having to run the shortcut again. For this, I used the handy app, WidgetPack. WidgetPack is an app that lets you build and update widgets using a Shortcut. So I have a separate Shortcut that is run after my primary one to get the amount remaining and display on the widget, along with the days until my next payday and the last time it was run. Here’s what the widget looks like: (The grey box was added to cover my actual amount remaining, for privacy’s sake.) The nice thing with WidgetPack is that you can configure the widget to run a shortcut (via internal url) when you tap it, so if I want to update my amount remaining, I just have to tap on the widget to run it. If you’d like to try something similar, I’ve shared the links to the two shortcuts I use below. These Shortcuts haven’t been configured to be super shareable, but should give you an idea of how to recreate something similar or make it your own.\nList of Shortcuts # Amount Remaining Shortcut Remaining Widget ","date":"March 24, 2024","permalink":"/posts/how-i-budget/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"How I Budget with Shortcuts on iOS"},{"content":"There’s a now relatively old The Oatmeal comic about buying software that’s always resonated with me. The whole thing is worth a read and still stands up, but I’ll summarize it briefly. Basically, it describes a person buying numerous expensive things without a thought, and then stopping to think really hard about whether to buy a 99 cent app on their phone. Reader, this is you: admit it.\nI’m probably the opposite in this regard, and again, a weird statistical blip, but I really like trying new software and will gladly pay for it. I just find it fun! I’ll plop down five or ten bucks to try something new just to see if it will stick. (This is the role of the “University” in my Productivity Town.) I do this because it’s fun, but I do recognize that trying new productivity software is no one’s idea of fun. But I’d like you to hear me out that it might be worth making a space to pay for more software in your life, especially from independent developers.\nCategories of Software #Free Software #Let’s start with ‘free’ software. Free software comes in basically three categories:\nFree to use with no strings (usually, but not always, open-source software). Free to use with ads. Free to use, but with limited functionality unless you pay. I use a bunch of stuff from Category 1. Homebridge is an open source, well-built and maintained application that lets you run non-Apple HomeKit certified smart home accessories within the Apple Home app. It’s so cool that so many people freely contribute their time to this project. I have no time for Category 2. I find modern digital ads to be so obtrusive, obnoxious, and almost always some sort of scam or shady operation that it just bothers me to see ads so much when I’m using software. That’s putting aside the array of tracking information that modern ad tech puts everywhere, that just gives me a gross feeling. Probably the only piece of software I use with ads in it with any regularity these days is Instagram, and if I could pay to remove ads from it, I would. And because I can’t, and because I’m constantly being bombarded with ads and other junk to help some Product Manager’s KPIs, I find I’m using Instagram less and less these days. Category 3 is where things start to get good. I actually really like this model a lot because it lets you try an app for free and then decide whether you like it enough to pay for the extra features.\nPaid Software #Paid software is a bit more straightforward. Either you pay a one-time fee for that software or you pay for a subscription to use it (this is a variant of Category 3 basically, and most paid software falls into this category these days.) I think that most people are generally the most comfortable with this approach to a point, only because it seems pretty straightforward. I pay this much, and then I ‘own’ this piece of software. The major problem with this is that people have basically stopped doing this, for whatever reason (see, again, the Oatmeal comic) and it’s very rare to even see one-time software, with most paid software being subscription software. So let’s talk about subscriptions, realistically, the only form of paid software these days. People hate subscriptions, and I get it. People talk about ‘subscription fatigue’ and balk at having to pay to subscribe for software. That when they stop paying, they don’t really ‘own’ the software anymore. While this is true, subscription software doesn’t really bother me for a couple of reasons. First is that before subscription software, software was really expensive. The Microsoft Office suite cost something like $5001 when it came in a box on CD or floppy drives. And ostensibly, you owned it and didn’t have to pay to keep using it. Except that if you got a new computer with a new operating system, that version you got may not be compatible with it, and you’d have to plop down another $500 for a new version (or maybe a smaller amount for an ‘upgrade’ version.) Or perhaps the new version had really compelling new features that you wanted, or introduced a new file format that people started sending you that are only readable in the new version. So let’s say over the course of 10 years, you spent $1000 on Microsoft Office by buying it twice. That averages out to about $100 a year, which, maybe not coincidentally, is roughly what Microsoft charges for an annual Microsoft Office 365 subscription now. So, even if you weren’t paying a subscription, your costs would have been about the same either way. Therefore, I’d argue that subscriptions are, love them or hate them, not all that different from one-time payments when it comes to software. That’s because most software is really a service, that’s powered by people, and it needs maintenance and updates. That was true when software was shipped in a box, and it’s still true today. And I like subscriptions because they actually give you several options you never had before. If you just want to test the waters on a piece of software, you can pay for it for a month or two to try it out. If it’s not for you, you can walk away from it, and you haven’t wasted a huge upfront cost. Plus, subscriptions often fund continual improvements, so your app gets better and better over time in incremental updates throughout the year. And while you can certainly subscribe to Microsoft 365 or Adobe Creative Cloud or what have you, I think there is a better and far cooler way, and that way is “Indie” software.\nIndie Software #Indie software is software that’s frequently made by one person, or occasionally a small team. This software is very rarely funded by venture capital, and is not very likely to have a big IPO and make its investors rich. Typically, these are side projects for people, or if not, a means to providing a moderate, honest living. Because there’s not a promise of a ton of money for indie software, I generally find the motivation is just to make really great software that the developers are proud of. In the same way that artists aren’t in it for the money, but for the passion of making great stuff. This isn’t an argument to under-pay software developers or artists. They can and should deserve to make a living from their work. But I find when the primary motiviation is the craft and not the money, the end result tends to be better. Is it all good? No, probably not. Am I generalizing? Most likely. But some of my favourite software is indie software, and I mostly feel good about paying for it, knowing my money’s going towards people who are just trying to make cool stuff they can stand behind.\nWrap Up and Recommendations #So there’s my case to try paying for software, especially indie software. I honestly don’t know how compelling an argument any of this was, so I’ll just wrap up with a few recommendations for some indie software that I love. Most of this software is Apple/iOS only. One of the things I really like about Apple’s platforms is it tends to attract really great indie developers who make quality apps like the ones below.\nBear is a notes software that I like a lot. It basically does everything Apple Notes does, but in a way that just feels prettier to me. Sequels is a nice way to collect lists of TV shows, movies, books and games that you want to consume in a very pretty format with nice media art and stuff. Anybox is a way to store and organize, well, anything I guess, but I use it to store bookmarks and add tags and notes to them so I can find stuff easily later. You can do this in your browser, but I find it really handy to do this in an app. Soulver 3 is like a combination of notepad and calculator. I find it’s really handy for doing some quick calculations with notes on your phone without having to resort to making a whole spreadsheet. Callsheet is an app that lets you look up movies and find cast and crew information. Sure, you can do this on Google, or through IMBD, but this app has not ads or other junk and is just focused on nicely getting you the information you want quickly. I didn’t research this or adjust for inflation or anything, but it was something in this ballpark either way.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"March 16, 2024","permalink":"/posts/why-software/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Why I like Paying for Software"},{"content":"Intro #Like most people my age, I’ve been witness to a total transformation in how people watch TV over the course of my life. I’m actually old enough that the very first TV I watched was black and white, and over the air, with about 3–4 channels on a good day. Then at some point pretty early on, we got a colour TV and cable, opening up way more channels, and getting to see things like music videos and cartoons in full colour.\nThen the cable companies introduced the electronic guide and a plethora of extra ‘digital’ channels, and finally the PVR. Each of these steps, for me, was pretty awesome — especially the PVR. The PVR finally let me easily record stuff I’d otherwise miss, skip commercials, and save up stuff to ‘binge.’ It was a total game changer for me, and I loved it. In many ways, it felt like a presage of what came next: streaming TV.\nFor me, streaming TV started with Netflix, and it was… pretty okay? Early Netflix in Canada had a few good things, but it was no replacement for cable. It got better over time, adding some great shows that were worth the monthly subscription on their own. And then more streaming apps came, opening up the options a lot more, as well as the cost.\nOver time, my family and I ended up watching about 99% of stuff over streaming, but there were still some shows that weren’t really easily ‘streamable.’ Most notably, Saturday Night Live1, Jeopardy and live events like the Oscars, election coverage, etc.\nSo we kept paying a stupid amount for our cable subscription just for the privilege of watching a few things we couldn’t get elsewhere. But it was never lost on me that all of those shows and events I mentioned were still actually available over the air, the place I originally started watching TV. So I set out to solve this edge case with pure nerdery (and a bit of a capital investment) and finally put cable TV to bed forever.\nMy Current TV Setup #Step 1: The Antenna #It’s a well-kept secret that over-the-air TV got really good in the mid-2000s with the advent of digital broadcasting and HDTV. If you can get a clear signal, the quality of picture you get over the air is great. It’s actually a better signal than you’d get over cable because the cable companies have to compress the hell out of all of their signals to jam as many channels as they can through their wires. So I knew I wanted those signals, and my first challenge was getting and mounting an antenna.\nYou can get indoor antennas, which are fine, but everything I read said that it’s best to have a big-ass antenna outside, mounted as high as possible to get the most channels. I didn’t feel like going on my roof to install one, or paying someone to do the same. But we had recently built a big new shed in the backyard. I’d run electricity and ethernet to it, so I could work from the shed occasionally. So, maybe there was a way of installing the antenna there and piping the signals back to my house using ethernet? And then setting up some sort of computer with a hard drive to record stuff and let me play it back wherever I wanted?\nBefore I got too far, I wanted to do a test to just see how many channels I could get with an antenna. So I bought a fair-sized antenna from kijiji2 for $20 and set it up outside and just hooked it up to my TV, holding the antenna up on a broom stick to get it as high as possible. I’m sure I looked like a total weirdo to my neighbours, but the experiment was a success. I actually got Jeopardy over the air!\nSuccessfully completing this step gave me confidence to mount the antenna and further invest in the solution. I bought a proper mounting arm for the antenna, and actually mounted it inside my shed. This is because the mounting arm gave me several scary disclaimers about mounting too near electrical wires (electrical wires run right behind my shed) and about properly grounding it in case of lightning strike. So I tested again to see if I got decent signal inside my shed, and I did, so I mounted it there. It wasn’t pretty, but it’s a shed, so.\nStep 2: The PVR #My next step was figuring out how to solve 2 problems:\nWatching the TV somewhere besides my shed Recording stuff Step 1 was solved with the use of a roughly $150 device called the “HD Homerun.” Basically, this is a little box where you plug in a cable from an antenna and an ethernet cord connected to your network. Once that’s done, you can use their free app for your smartphone, streaming device, or through a web browser. The free software it comes with can record as well (if you pay a small subscription to get TV listings from a service.) The free software was… fine. And perfectly serviceable. But I just found it clunky, and I wanted better.\nEnter, Channels, a very nice app that can read the signals from the Homerun and give you a pretty guide and also record stuff. Channels has a paid app for the Apple TV (my streaming device of choice) and shows you TV fed from the Homerun. But if you want to record stuff, you need to install their software on an always-on computer with enough storage to store your stuff. For that version, it’s a roughly $10/month subscription.\nSo I installed the Channels on an old Mac laptop with a 2TB hard drive attached to it to try it out. Within about ten minutes of using it, I immediately entered my credit card details because I liked it so much. Once it’s all set up, the computer just sits there doing its thing, and you mainly interact with it using one of their apps. You can scroll through the guide, and if you see a show you want to record, you can create a ‘pass’ to record and keep every episode. And you can even set it up so that you can watch TV, or your recorded stuff, anywhere there’s an internet connection. You can even download your recorded shows to your phone or tablet through their app, for the airplane or what have you.\nSolution Overview #So here’s a very simplified set-up of what I’ve got set up now.\nNot shown here is the fact that any tablet, phone, or computer on my network can access stuff on Channels as well.\nThoughts and Observations About My TV Setup #I’ve been running with this set-up for roughly six months now, and I am still just loving it so much. I canceled our cable subscription about a month after having it and have seldom regretted it. We can now watch Jeopardy or SNL in stunning quality whenever we want. And there’s a surprisingly lot of good stuff on broadcast TV! I’ve been watching cool documentaries from PBS and CBC and TVO. CTV will often air decent movies on Saturdays that I can record. And there’s a ton of old sitcoms I loved, like Cheers and Seinfeld, that I’m recording and building up a collection of. There’s so much good stuff I want to keep that I ended up getting a massive 16TB hard drive to add to my setup so I wouldn’t ever have to worry about running out of space.\nAnd because Channels doesn’t have any deals with content creators or need to worry about weird licensing or other deals, they just build in features that are useful and helpful for their customers.\nAwesome Things About Channels #Commercial Detection and Skipping #After (and even in the middle of) recording a show, Channels can detect all the commercial breaks. Then, when you’re watching a show, instead of having to fast-forward through the breaks, you get a nice ‘skip commercials’ button that pops up that clicks you right past them. You can even make this automatic, so the commercials will always just skip.3 The commercial detection gets a little glitchy on live shows like SNL, but has generally been rock solid for me, and I love it so much. Skipping commercials is not something that cable companies would ever build into their PVR at the risk of alienating their broadcast partners.\nWatching Stuff Away from Home #My last cable provider actually had a half-decent app that let you watch stuff live, watch stuff you’ve recorded, and even let you download your recordings for offline viewing, with a few big asterisks. The asterisks are that each of those features being available depended entirely on the licensing deals they were able to put together. So if you were in another country, for instance, none of these features worked at all because their licensing was for Canada only. And not all channels were available to stream in the app. And even some of the stuff you recorded sometimes couldn’t be downloaded, depending on the licensing deals. I get while all these deals are in place, but as a consumer, it just stank.\nChannels, because it’s just freely and legally letting you record stuff over the air, doesn’t care about any of that. As long as your Internet connection is good enough (and you’ve configured your network the right way) you can watch anything anywhere. You can download anything anywhere. They just give you, the viewer, maximum control over what you want to do with what you’ve recorded. It’s wonderful.\nVirtual Channels and Playlists #Virtual Channels are a fun feature of the Channels app that you configure based on content you’ve recorded that show up alongside regular channels. For instance, I have a virtual channel called “Sitcoms” that plays sitcoms that I’ve recorded, back to back, in a random order. The really neat thing is if you ‘tune in’ to a virtual channel, it starts playing based on when it was ‘scheduled.’ So you might end up seeing the last five minutes of something, or start five minutes in, just like watching TV in the old days. (There is a button to let you start from the beginning if you really want to.) I’ve found Virtual Channels are great channels for just throwing on something in the background while you’re cleaning or doing laundry or something and don’t really want to have to think about what you want to watch.\nChannels also recently introduced “Playlists.” Just like music playlists, you can make your own custom playlists, say of movies or episodes of shows you like. You can even ‘shuffle’ the playlists to just play them in a random order. You can also set up playlists using “smart rules.” So I have a playlist that just shows everything I’ve recorded but not yet watched, in order from newest to latest. And another one of just stuff I’ve watched, so I can quickly go through and delete stuff I don’t want anymore.\nVirtual Channels and Playlists are such cool features that I’ve never seen anywhere else. I could see them being neat features of streaming apps. Imagine going to Netflix and making your own ‘channel’ of stuff you like from it, or a playlist of your favourite holiday episodes of different shows? I honestly think there is a real lack of imagination, or just some sort of weird reverence for ‘the algorithm’ that’s holding back streaming apps from implementing features like this. (Or, it’s very possible I’m just an edge case and these features wouldn’t actually be that popular.)\nSumming Up #So that’s my TV set up in 2024. I love this setup so much that I use it every day and that I’ve now written about 2000 words talking about. I do recognize that a lot of my enthusiasm for this comes down to pure nerdery, and most people probably don’t care enough to put this much money or effort into setting up something similar.\nBut when I really think about what I love about this setup so much, it’s the control and agency that I have. I can choose to get good quality video, not compressed to hell by the cable companies. I can mix and match and watch stuff I’ve recorded in several ways not possible through streaming apps or cable company PVRs. It just feels so cool to have so much agency and control over what I watch and how I watch it.\nThere’s a lot of talk about ‘cord cutters’ leaving cable because of high prices, or ‘subscription fatigue’ from people signing up to tons of streaming services. I wonder if the real root of this is just this annoying lack of agency that streaming services and cable companies put on how we watch stuff. My setup isn’t cheap or free, but I do not at all resent paying for it. I wonder if the content holders and app builders let people have a little more control and agency over how they watched stuff, if people wouldn’t feel so bummed out about how much they are paying for them?\nSNL requires a cable subscription to stream live and watching ‘on demand’ after strips out the musical guests and adds a bunch of un-skippable ads.

There are a ton of systems and frameworks to help you manage all this and be productive. But, like project frameworks, they tend to use a lot of complicated jargon and very inflexible systems. I think this makes it challenging for people who feel like if they aren’t following the system exactly, or can’t keep all the terminology straight, they just want to give up. That’s why I’ve been finding the metaphor of a town to be a helpful way to think about how I approach personal productivity. I like to think of this as a small industrial town with a river running through it. In the town is a Factory, a Library and a University. The Factory takes in goods and requests, and ships them out to customers. The Library curates and organizes knowledge so that people can easily access it. And the University educates and innovates, creating new knowledge to be shared to the Library. In this town, all three of these buildings depend on each other, and most importantly, depend on the River to receive new things and ship things out. In some ways, then, the most important job is that of the Dockworker, who looks out for the right things in the river and gets them to the right place in the town. If we apply this metaphor to reality, the River is the flow of information that comes your way, be it through email, text messages, conversations, or even new ideas that spring to mind. The Factory is how you manage and do the things from the River that need to get done. The Library is where you store helpful information you come across so you can retrieve it later when you need it. And the University is a place to learn and experiment with different ways of doing things, which may make their way back to the Factory or the Library if they’re useful. I’ll walk through each part of the town to explain a bit more and discuss different ways this metaphor could be useful.\nThe River #As I mentioned, the River is the most important aspect of the town. In real life, towns and cities are often formed on a river because of their importance for trade. And unlike everything else in the town, the river isn’t made by people. It’s a force of nature that can be tamed somewhat, but never really stops flowing. This is why I find it such a useful metaphor for information that we deal with. Like a river, information flows past us all day, and it’s very difficult to stop it. In fact, we probably wouldn’t want to stop it even if we could! Lots of important information flows through our River, and we don’t want to miss the good stuff. But realistically, a ton of the information that flows past is really not that important, and there’s usually so much of it that we end up missing the good stuff, or the important stuff that needs our attention. So, like the fictional Dockworker in our town then, we need to be on the lookout for the important, or useful information that flows past us and make sure we can capture it and get it to the right place quickly before it flows past us to be forgotten. Dealing with the River information is honestly the hardest part of getting productive. There’s just so much stuff, and it never stops! Email is a great example of something that flows along our information river. Our email inboxes are flooded with so many marketing emails, social notifications and other junk that it’s easy to miss the important stuff. Maybe it’s your kid’s teacher or that request from a friend asking to hang out will easily get lost. If there isn’t a way to look out for it and action it before it flows away in the mass of additional marketing emails, to be easily forgotten. I’ll share one quick tip about email that will make your inner Dockworker’s job a lot easier: use that unsubscribe link. Businesses in most jurisdictions are legally obliged to make it easy to unsubscribe from their lists and honour those requests. Make it a habit to unsubscribe from every email you get from a business that you really don’t care about anymore. If you do this for a couple of weeks, and keep doing it when new ones pop up, you’d be surprised at how much more useful your email becomes, and how less likely you are to miss something important.1 So go unsubscribe now — it’s fun! So to sum up, managing the River of information involves two basic strategies:\nIdentifying and putting aside the good stuff. Stopping as much junk and irrelevant stuff from flowing downstream as you can to make #1 more successful.2 The Factory #In our metaphor, the Factory is a place to make things. It’s the Dockworker’s job to make sure that the right raw materials and requests for stuff are sent to the Factory for fulfillment. But it’s the job of the Factory Manager to process all the new work orders and materials coming in, making sure the requests are met in time, and continually improving the factory’s operations to make the factory more efficient. In our real life, the Factory can take many forms. One form is probably some sort of to-do list, where you keep track of the important things you need to do and when. The other is the way in which you do work or get things done, whatever they are. If you’re a tradesperson, this might mean buying a new tool that makes a routine job quicker. If you’re a video editor, maybe it means upgrading your computer to speed up video encoding. Or, if you’re an information worker of any sort, a new software application that can automate the routine tasks you do. Just like with a factory, even incremental improvements, if they are towards very frequent tasks, can make a big difference. One small example that is relevant to almost everyone, that is decades old at this point, is keyboard shortcuts. Sure, you probably know the basic ones like copy and paste. But it’s very likely that whatever application you use the most has keyboard shortcuts for almost every function in it.3 So let’s say there’s a function you do about 100 times a day. It takes one second to move your hand to the mouse, find the right command, and click on it. It’s likely that the equivalent keyboard shortcut would take about half a second to do. If you do extrapolate that over a week, that’s 7 minutes of your week back, just by switching to the keyboard shortcut for that task. Start doing that for more and more tasks, and those minutes really start to add up to something! So to sum up our strategies for the Factory, they are:\nOrganizing the list of things to do Making doing the things more efficient The Library #The next building in our metaphorical town is the Library. In our town, the Library is a place where people can access knowledge on various subjects (or, just find some entertainment and diversion.) The Library is managed, of course, by the Librarian. It’s their job to make sure the Library has materials on a wide variety of different subjects, and makes accessing those materials easy by having an accessible organization system so people can find what they’re looking for easily. So what’s the Library in real life? Real libraries, are, of course, an invaluable real-life resource that many people have access to and should take advantage of. But when I think of the metaphorical library, I’m thinking of the place or places that you organize all the information that is, or could be, important to you, so you can access it at the right time. This could take the form of a notebook or notes application, a filing cabinet, an actual collection of books, or all of the above and more. Just like with a real library, though, the important thing about your personal library is that it’s curated and accessible. Curated in that it’s a collection of things that are, or could be, helpful to you, and accessible in that it’s well organized and easy to find the right information at the right time. Think about the notes app that’s on your phone. This is one form of a personal library, in that it’s a place where you store information that you want to access later. I’m sure many people add countless notes of things to remember in their notes app. But how relevant is everything that’s accumulated in there? And how easy is it to find stuff? Maybe you wrote down an important piece of information like your eye-glasses prescription in your notes app a few years ago, and now you need a new pair of glasses, and you want to find it again. You could search for the note, but what if you named it “specs scrip” and you’re now searching for “glasses prescription”? Search won’t help you there. And if your notes are full of junk, all in one big folder, it’s going to be even harder to find it. So, if you’re a user of notes apps, it’s important to both find useful stuff to jot down and add, as well as to occasionally work on your list of notes to purge ones that are no longer relevant, and organize and make searchable the ones that are. Part of the former means working with your inner Dockworker to make sure they are sending you relevant stuff that you might want for later, and purging stuff that’s not really that relevant anymore. The latter might involve making folders for your notes, as well as giving them relevant titles, or using tagging functionality to make sure they easily pop up in various different types of searches you might do. So the Library, like the other buildings, has two basic strategies:\nCurate relevant knowledge. Make the knowledge easy to access. The University #The next building in our metaphorical town is the University. In our town, the University’s role is to educate as well as to research, experiment and develop new knowledge. So the job of the University’s Dean is to balance these two parts of its mission, by making sure there are good instructional practices in place, attracting the right students, and to create a good space for research and experimentation. And the Dean will work closely with the Librarian to make sure that important knowledge it creates is archived and catalogued, so others can make use of it (including its students.) In real life, universities, like libraries, are actual, invaluable resources for people who are eager to learn new things. And lifelong learning is an important part of a balanced life. But when I think about my metaphorical university, I focus more on its research and experimentation function. That means trying new things and new ways of working to see if they will stick. One type of experimentation I love doing is trying new software. Seriously, I constantly do this. I have a pretty well trusted to-do list and note-taking applications at this point, but that absolutely will not stop me from trying a new to-do list or note-taking app just to give it a spin. Many times, I end up not using them, but once in a while I do, and it becomes a game changer for how I manage my life. One advantage of trying new software in 2024 is that it’s straightforward and usually at no cost. App stores make it trivially easy to safely install new applications to your devices. And, love it or hate it, the subscription pricing model of many modern applications makes it easy to try new software before you pay for it. I may be an outlier in finding trying new applications fun, but that, of course, doesn’t have to be the only way to experiment with new ways of doing things. What are the areas in your life or workflow where you can try new experiments? So to sum up the University, its strategy again boils down to two things:\nContinually learning new things. Experiment with different types of things to see if they will be helpful. The Church #I didn’t discuss the Church above, so think about this as a little bonus building in our town. In our town, the Church is a place where the community congregates regularly to reflect about things that are greater than themselves. Sometimes we (well, certainly I) can get so caught up in getting things done and being productive that it leaves other parts of us unfulfilled. Like the other buildings, going to a church or other religious institution is a real thing that people can certainly do, and something that certainly can fulfill the need to congregate and contemplate greater things. But your metaphorical Church doesn’t have to be one of those places. I consider myself a pretty devout atheist, but I do sometimes envy my church-going friends, and I’ve been trying to find more ways to congregate. It’s probably not perfect, but I’ve been playing Badminton at my local YMCA for the past few months every Monday. It’s really nice to have a regular spot to interact with a group of regulars in my community. And while perhaps not as profound as contemplating the existence of life or the afterlife, I do find working on strengthening my badminton skills a rewarding activity.\nThe Town Charter #So that’s a tour of my little productivity town. We have a River, with goods and information flowing through it, tended by the Dockworker who is on the lookout for good and relevant stuff and makes sure it gets to the right place in town. Next to the River, we have the Factory, taking in goods and requests from the Dockworker, and working to fulfill them as efficiently as possible. Then there’s the library, managed by the fastidious Librarian, curating and organizing a continually evolving collection of knowledge. The University educates denizens of the town and breaks new ground wth innovative research and experimentation. And finally, we have the Church, where the townspeople congregate regularly to stop and reflect on the greater things in life. Overseeing the town of course, is The Mayor, who works according to the Town Charter to make sure the town continues to be a good place to live for its citizens. While many towns are similar, each town is unique. So think about your little town, with you as the mayor. What would your town charter say? What buildings are in your town, and how do they work?\nWhile you’re at it, go to your social sites liked LinkedIN, Facebook, Twitter, etc, and just turn off all email notifications available. Product Managers at those companies are constantly adding new notification types to try to drive some sort of engagement KPI, so you’ll have to periodically prune these new ones every now and then. Don’t worry, you’ll still get all the notifications when you go to the site.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nTo be fair, this is maybe more the mayor’s job than the dockworker’s.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIf you use a Mac, check the menubar for the function you want to do.

The impact of safety regulations and cheaper microchips, cameras, and sensors has led to an explosion in computer-powered features in cars that were once reserved mainly for the luxury market. I’m a gadget nerd, and I’m always obsessed by the different features cars have, so I’ve been all over these and love using them in my car. But I think this explosion has happened so quickly that most people don’t even realize they have half of these features. So consider this post a public service announcement for some new features your car probably has, but you probably don’t use.\nCarPlay / Android Auto #CarPlay (for iPhones) and Android Auto (for Android phones) is a way of showing a version of your phone on your car’s display in a way that makes it easier (and safer) to use than your phone. It means you can use a nice, big map, control your music, and even hear text messages and reply by voice when you drive. If you bought a car in the past 5 years, it’s very likely your car this technology. But since I still see so many cars on the road that I know are capable of having this technology but where people have either mounted their phone or (GIANT FACEPALM) using their phone in their hand while they drive, I think a lot of people just don’t know about this.\nNot only does CarPlay/Android Auto make it more convenient to use than your phone, it’s also WAY SAFER to use. This is because they’ve optimized the user interface to have big, readable buttons so you can quickly glance at what you need to and then back on the road. And they won’t ever present you with a keyboard to type things due to the distraction it represents.\nI have to point out here that even if your car doesn’t have this technology, you should not be using your phone while driving. I know smartphones are a little addictive and difficult to ignore, but you have to remember that when you’re driving a car, you’re operating a machine that can kill or seriously injure people. The risk vs. reward of using your phone while you drive is so out of whack that I honestly think anyone who uses their phone while they drive should be ashamed of themselves. If you can’t control your impulse to check it while you drive, put it in your trunk or glove compartment.\nAutomatic Climate Control #This feature is still a little less popular, and not usually available in the base model of cars, but I highly recommend going to the model that has it. Automatic climate control basically works like the thermostat in your house works: you just pick a temperature and the system tries to get your environment to that temperature. In a car, this is even better than in a house because you don’t even need to pick between heating and cooling modes. I just set my car’s desired temperature to 21 Celsius, and if it needs to kick in the AC to cool the car to get it there, it does so. If it needs to kick the heat in to get it there, it’ll do so. It will even kick the fan into high mode automatically if your desired temperature is way off from the current temperature to get you there faster. Before automatic climate control, you were forced to almost constantly futz with your climate control yourself. You know the drill. In the winter, you’d crank your heat and fans up, then realize it was too hot, then you’d crank it down. Then it would get too cold, and you’d start the whole process over again. The thing is, this is what automatic climate control does for you. It just heats until it gets to the desired temperature, then shuts off. Off-boarding this task to your car’s computer just makes so much sense and lets you focus more on actually driving. While I’m on this, I just have to mention one thing about the desired temperature, which is true of houses and cars. Setting your thermostat to a super high temperature will not heat your house or car faster. Whatever temperate you set, your system just heats until it gets there and stops. Setting a high temperature is not at all the same thing as slamming on your car’s gas pedal. (All of this is of course true in the inverse for cooling.)\nAutomatic Cruise Control #Cruise control used to work by setting a desired speed, and having your car handle the acceleration to maintain that speed. Which is a great thing for when you are on a long stretch of highway with no one in front of you. But that scenario (the no one in front of you part) is so rare these days. Basically, every highway that I drive on with any regularity will have someone in front of me. So in this context, cruise control basically becomes useless. If someone ahead of you is going slightly slower than you, you have to turn it off and probably tap the brakes to avoid slamming into them. Automatic cruise control uses the power of cheap sensors and computers to sense the car in front of you, and reduce your speed to match theirs automatically. So if you set your desired speed to 110 km/hr, your car will go that speed until it gets behind someone going 108 km/hr, and then will just match that speed automatically. So you can just put on automatic cruise control, and your car will automatically keep up with traffic. I find having this on makes me so much less tired after a long drive. I should say that, again, a car is a dangerous machine, and you absolutely should not use automatic cruise control as a way to less attention to the road. If anything, I find the power of advanced cruise control, automatic climate control and other things actually frees up my attention to pay more attention to the road, and I think I’m a better and safer driver because of it. So there you go — three things about your car you probably didn’t know it had. Go and try them, but above, be safe and vigilant while you drive!\n","date":"March 1, 2024","permalink":"/posts/things-car/things-your-car-can-do-that-you-probably-didnt-realize/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Things Your Car Can Do That You Probably Didn’t Realize"},{"content":"I’ve been professionally involved in some sort of project management now for almost 20 years. Before that, (like most people) I’ve led or been a part of “projects” of one sort or another for probably another 20 years, if you count school projects, plays that I’ve produced, or even events like my wedding, parties or vacations. At the risk of sounding immodest, I think I’m pretty good at managing projects, and I have some ideas about them. Lots of ideas! A few years ago, after experience with various project methodologies, I came up with a simple theory about the basics of good project management. I think this theory is applicable to just about every methodology, from agile to scrum to waterfall and kanban and everything else in between. Basically, boils down to this:\nAll successful projects, at a minimum, have these two things in common:\nThey have a list of things People review the list of things regularly I know that seems simple and probably obvious, but it’s actually kind of amazing how seldom a lot of project teams don’t actually do either of those two things. Obviously, there’s lots of other stuff to consider when planning and managing a project. But seriously, if you do nothing else on a project but those two things, I guarantee your project will be more successful than if you didn’t. That said, I will elaborate a bit on this theory for better clarity. One of the challenges I see with a lot of project management methodologies is that they tend to use a lot of confusing and bespoke jargon. So I’m going to describe this all in as plain language as possible to make it accessible and demonstrate how straightforward good project management really is.\nA List of Things #What is a list of things? In a project, it’s usually a list of things to be done. Could this be a list of risks? A list of issues? Sure! That said, a list of things to be done is probably the most important kind of list, and anything else is gravy. Again, just having this list of things puts you like 99% ahead of how many teams manage projects. But if you want to refine your list and make it really effective, there are a few things to consider.\nThings Should Be Specific #Things on your list should generally be descriptive enough that it’s obvious what needs to be done because things that are ambiguous tend to get stuck. For example, if you’re building a house, “Roof” might be a thing you want to put on your list to capture the task of building a roof. That’s a start. But “Build roof for the house” is probably a better name because it describes what needs to be done pretty definitively.\nThings Should Be Granular #Things on your list should be granular enough that you can cross them off regularly and get a sense of how well your project is moving along. In the above example, “Build roof for the house” might be fine as a Big Thing on your list. But if you really want to measure progress and coordinate well, you probably want to log a few smaller things related to it that you’d want to track (like “get shingles,” “install shingles,” “install flashing,”) etc. That said, you don’t want to get too granular with your tasks. If you start listing out tasks like “Get in car,” “Start car,” “Go to Home Depot,” “Pay for shingles,” etc., you’re probably getting to a point where maintaining your list is more effort than it’s worth. There’s no hard and fast rule as to how granular a task should be, (and different frameworks have opinions on this) but a project management instructor I once had summed it up pretty well as “a task should be as granular as it needs to be, but no more.” So it’s really a judgement call, as well as something that you’ll get right with trial and error over time.\nThings Should Have Helpful Details #There are a few details about the things on your list that will further remove ambiguity and help get them done. In my experience, the most important ones are usually:\nWho is responsible for completing this thing? When does this thing need to be done by? There’s a ton more detail you can add to tasks on your list, and it will really vary by team and project, but if nothing else, if you have those and nothing else, you’re ahead of the game. One other aspect I find helpful to have is a record of the discussion about a thing on the list. I’ll get more into this in Section 2 (“_ Reviewing the List Regularly_”). The List Should Be Fungible #Fungible is a fancy way of saying that something can be easily changed. With the list of things, one of the most aspects that should be fungible is the order in which your things are listed. It’s usually helpful to have the most important stuff at the top of your list, with stuff getting less important the further you go down. Over the course of a project, new things will come up, and you’ll need to figure out whether they go higher or lower than existing items. And some items might just drop off entirely or become more or less important than originally thought. There are a ton of different ways to maintain things your list. I have my opinions and preferences, but the way you track your list is going to come down to the needs of the project, the tools available to you or your organization, and the preferences and working style of people involved. Your list could be as simple as a piece of paper or a board of sticky notes, or as complex as powerful project management software. Often, spreadsheet applications (especially collaborative ones like Google Sheets) are perfectly fine as a starting point for simple projects.\nReviewing the List Regularly #A list that’s written down and put in a drawer isn’t really going to help anyone manage a project. Conversely, just meeting regularly to discuss a project with no list won’t be very helpful either. The secret sauce is meeting with people on the project regularly, and reviewing things on the list. Like many other aspects, how regularly comes down to the needs of the project, and in some cases the project framework that’s being used, or even the working styles of the project team. But what about “reviewing the list?” What does that even mean? Reviewing the list can be done in many ways. Whatever way is used, I’ve found it’s best to be systematic about it by doing it the same way every time you review it. I often find the best way is to start with the most important thing on the list first and work your way down from there. With each item on the list, I generally find it’s helpful to ask a few questions of each thing:\nHow is this thing coming along? If there’s a deadline, do we still think we’ll hit it? Is there anything getting in the way of us doing this thing? If so, what is it, and what’s to be done about it? What’s next on the road to completing this thing? Are we sure we even need to do this thing anymore? Usually, if a list item is assigned to someone, the person running the project or meeting asks these questions to the person assigned, but a lot of them can also be asked of the group as well.\nWhy is This so Important? #Meeting regularly to review items on a list, I’ve found, is extremely effective. One of the reasons I’ve found this to be true is that people on a project, like most humans, are busy and forgetful. Meeting to review the items serves, if nothing else, as a reminder to people of the things they need to do. Over time, knowing the review meeting is coming up, people will naturally want to try to finish their thing on the list so they can bring some good news to the meeting. The other reason is that often people can just get stuck trying to do the things they’re supposed to do. Of course, people can, and should be encouraged, to reach out for help between review meetings to help get the thing unstuck. But occasionally I’ve found that people may not even realize they are stuck on the task until they start talking about it, which is prompted by the review. And sometimes even just talking about where they are stuck will help them get unstuck. And if not, they have a group of people who can help think of ways to get the task unstuck, or even offer to lend a hand.\nRecording the Review #As I mentioned before, it’s usually helpful to have some sort of record of the conversation about a thing during the review. Because people are forgetful, this serves as a helpful reminder to the group about where they’re at with the thing. Maybe there was a reason why it was stuck that was uncovered last meeting. Having this recorded and referenced during the review meeting oftentimes avoids having to have that conversation again and jumping quickly to why it’s stuck and what to do about it. Recording the review is where tracking things as sticky notes on a board really falls down for me and why I don’t typically recommend it (along with many other reasons). But I know physical sticky notes can be a bit of an article of faith for some project practitioners, so if that’s what you’re comfortable with, go for it. But going with a more digital option might be a solve for you if you\u0026rsquo;re finding you’re rehashing the same conversation around list items over and over.\nA Caveat #If you’re a seasoned project practitioner, I’m sure you’ve been yelling at your screen reading this.\n“But what about goals??! A project without a clear goal will never be successful! And you can’t have a successful project without good people!\nTo that, I would say: you’re right! Those are vital things and you should have them! But given that most people don’t even have a list and a way to regularly review the list, I still think it’s a good place to start. Once you start talking about things on a list, conversations about goals will naturally come up as it relates to things on the list (especially when you ask if you should really be doing this thing.) Also, setting a goal can and should also be a thing on your list! It will also become exceedingly obvious when you meet to review the list who is not pulling their weight on the project, especially if you are assigning things to people and tracking the conversation around the thing. This can be a helpful way to drive accountability with under-performers, or, worst case, prompt discussions about their role on the project team.\nWrapping Up #So a list of things and a way to review them regularly. Is it really that simple? Well, yes, and no. As we’ve covered, there are numerous things to consider regarding what goes on the list and how you review it. But think about it like learning a new game, like chess. The rules to chess are relatively simple and quick to learn (as long you want to). But getting decent at, let alone mastering chess, takes years of practice, and usually some innate talent. Project management is similar. So if you’re considering improving your project management game, think about the list of things and a review of the list as your starting point, your basic rules of the game. Stick to it, refine and improve it, and make it your own!\n","date":"February 23, 2024","permalink":"/posts/universal-theory-projects/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Universal Theory of Project Management "},{"content":" Tom Robertson Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m Tom!
