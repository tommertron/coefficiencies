+++

I had long admired / lusted after the [Ember mug](https://ember.com/products/ember-mug-2?variant=44461073793209) for keeping your drinks at a perfect temperature, and have heard great things about them from people who have them. But the very steep price put me off. 

I ended up getting a mug warmer for Christmas that plugs into the wall though, and it’s GREAT. It’s so nice to have my coffee stay warm as I slowly drink it over the morning. PLUS, it looks like a little record player and helps to prevent stains from showing up on my white desk.

I don’t know the exact brand or price as it was a gift, but you can find these fairly cheaply on Amazon, and I’d highly recommend them.
