Cool new app for iOS that sort of helps you brainstorm using ai and then creates items in Reminders for you based on what you come up with. Haven't tried it yet but it's on my list. 

I think one of the most under appreciated aspects of LLMs is their ability to create structured data like code or tables out of loose unorganized data. One of my top LLM use cases is just "make a table out of this blob of text."
