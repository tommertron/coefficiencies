thoughts about technology and work
{{< /lead >}}

In math, a "coefficient" is a number or constant that multiplies a variable. I like to think of technology as a sort of 'coefficient' to processes and systems. Technology can make a great process better by multitudes (and inversely, a bad process worse by multitudes.) This site focuses on finding ways to make technology and processes work better together. In other words - finding coefficiencies!
